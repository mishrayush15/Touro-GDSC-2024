          1.Fake Goods:
        </span>
        Be cautious when purchasing branded goods, especially from street vendors
        or markets. Counterfeit goods are prevalent in tourist areas, and buyers
        may end up with low-quality or fake items
      </div>
      <div class="div-12">
        <span style="text-decoration: underline; text-transform: uppercase">
          2.Overpriced Services:
        </span>
        Tourists may be charged inflated prices for services such as taxi rides,
        souvenirs, or food in tourist-heavy areas. Always check prices beforehand
        and be wary of establishments that don't display prices clearly.
      </div>
      <div class="div-13">
        <span style="text-decoration: underline; text-transform: uppercase">
          3.Unlicensed Tour Guides:
        </span>
        Some individuals may pose as tour guides without proper licenses. It's
        safer to book tours through reputable agencies or verify the credentials
        of individual guides before hiring them.
      </div>
      <div class="div-14">
        <span style="text-decoration: underline; text-transform: uppercase">
          4.Fake Tickets:
        </span>
        When purchasing tickets for attractions or events, especially from
        unofficial sellers or online platforms, there's a risk of buying
        counterfeit or invalid tickets. Stick to authorized sellers and official
        websites to avoid this scam.
      </div>
      <div class="div-15">
        <span style="text-decoration: underline; text-transform: uppercase">
          5.Distraction Theft:
        </span>
        Tourists may be targeted by thieves who use distraction techniques, such
        as asking for directions or spilling something on the victim, to steal
        belongings. Stay vigilant and keep your belongings secure at all times,
        especially in crowded places.
      </div>
      <div class="div-16">
        <span style="text-decoration: underline; text-transform: uppercase">
          6.&quot;Friendly&quot; Locals Offering Help:
        </span>
        While many locals are genuinely helpful, some may approach tourists
        offering assistance with directions or recommendations but then expect
        payment for their help. Politely decline if you're not comfortable, or
        offer a small tip if you feel the assistance was genuine.
      </div>
      <div class="div-17">
        <span style="text-decoration: underline; text-transform: uppercase">
          7.Credit Card Fraud:
        </span>
        Exercise caution when using credit cards, especially in smaller shops or
        restaurants. Card skimming devices may be used to steal card information.
        Stick to reputable establishments and consider using cash for smaller
        purchases.
      </div>
      <div class="div-18">
        <span style="text-decoration: underline; text-transform: uppercase">
          8.Rental Damage Scams:
        </span>
        When renting bicycles, cars, or other equipment, thoroughly inspect the
        item for existing damage before use and take photos if necessary. Some
        rental companies may try to charge tourists for pre-existing damage upon
        return.
